I already knew basics of Frontend development before the start of LEAD. I'd started learning Frontend Web Development from March. 
Looking forward to learn new techniques through the project.

While doing the project,
 - I learnt to use the flex property. 
 - I also learnt to use the css clip path generator which is really helpful in shaping different things.
